# RecNetSharp!
## A c# library for easily accessing data from RecRoom
### (This is currently still very incomplete, it's not done yet and will be improved or changed in the future!)

Using RecNetSharp is easy!

To use it, you must first be ```using RecNetSharp;```, then create an instance of RecNetClient.


example:
```cs

  async void CreateClient()
  {
    RecNetClient Client = new RecNetClient();
  }

```
